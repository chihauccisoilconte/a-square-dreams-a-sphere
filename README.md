# A Square dreams A Sphere

In this repository you will find all the outputs of the project "A Square dreams A Sphere" by "Chi ha ucciso il conte?".   
The repo contains executive files (.stl, .dxf, .png), and also editable CAD files. They are means as companions to the tutorials found on [the project's website](https://vimeo.com/album/4661933)

The sofware used for this projects were:   
- [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/)   
- [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org)  
- [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/)  


## About the project
“A square dreams A sphere” is an initiative that takes name from the book “Flatland” by Edwin
Abbott.; the story of “A square” that tries to convince his bi-dimensional society about the existence
of a third dimension.
Similar to the society described in the book, most of the 3d modelers community does not see any
proper alternative to the commercial softwares available. My initiative has the goal of breaking this idea
through the act of teaching that there's an alternative.

“A square dreams A sphere” is a project for the diffusion of the use of open-souce softwares in the
3d modeling and 3d printing field.
The project will consist in a series of free 3d modeling and 3d printing workshops around Europe,
with a total of more than 100 participants.
As a final result of this activity I would like to "plant a seed" for a fervent community of people who use
opensource software to develop their designs.

The project was funded by the [Creative Industries Fund](http://stimuleringsfonds.nl/) of the Netherlands
